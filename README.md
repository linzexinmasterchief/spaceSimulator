## update logs
### version 0.1.0 build1 2017/05/16
relaunched the project with a greater target, I planned to create planets and worlds on them, it is pretty difficult, so good luck to myself!
#### version 0.0.2 build2 2017/04/29
the project is nearly finished, now you can input negative mass and see what will happen!
#### version 0.0.2 build1 2017/04/11
fixed the NaN bug
### version 0.0.1 release 2017/04/09
add the gravity system, now you can set the mass and velocity!
#### version 0.0.1 build3 2017/04/08
fixed a few bugs, added the proto-acceleration system
#### version 0.0.1 build2 2017/04/05
made some impressive progress on code deploying, separating the code into different files makes code easier to manage. 
#### version 0.0.1 build1 2017/04/01
has a basic frame, while the content is still very boring. By the way, the background picture and the icon is just for testing.<pr>
I don't think we are able to use them since the competition requires original pictures :(
