# spaceSimulator
simulate the universe

the game will allow the character to travel through, 
even modify the universe. Moreover, player can also 
land on every planet, asteroid and star. I think maybe
"becoming god" is a better name.
## TODO list
* add collide system for planets
* design menu
* design settings
* add console
* use map files
* even better collisions
* changeable time speed
## update logs
#### version 0.1.3 alpha build1 2017/8/15
add a universe time speed adjuster
# ```version 0.1.2 beta```
`[2017/7/28] finally the third stable version released after 2 months`
#### version 0.1.2 alpha build7 2017/7/21
I made a better slider ui myself instead of using the ugly default one, you can now see the value of the slider directly in a more convenient way!
#### version 0.1.2 alpha build6 2017/7/14
added a star counter, reconstructed code, made it easier and faster to add new things.
#### version 0.1.2 alpha build5 2017/7/7
added icon, did some optimizations to the code.
#### version 0.1.2 alpha build4 2017/6/15
added mass and radius modifier, the color will now change according the mass, you can also pause the game by clicking middle button
#### version 0.1.2 alpha build3 2017/6/13
ok, I know I'm updating really slow, I'm sorry but I'm working all on my own so... anyway, I still fixed some bugs and made the program more flexible to add new options.
#### version 0.1.2 alpha build2 2017/6/7
now you have a menu! although it is still not completed, I will try to add some interesting controls into it. The graphic is also redesigned to make refresh faster.
#### version 0.1.2 alpha build1 2017/6/1
happy children's day! the program is optimized and a menu is added.
# ```version 0.1.1 beta```
`now you can resize on a point you want.`
#### version 0.1.0 alpha build2 2017/05/29
added size control system, now you have a larger universe and the ability to resize your view!
### version 0.1.0 alpha build1 2017/05/16
relaunched the project with a greater target, I planned to create planets and worlds on them, it is pretty difficult, so good luck to myself!
#### version 0.0.2 alpha build2 2017/04/29
the project is nearly finished, now you can input negative mass and see what will happen!
#### version 0.0.2 alpha build1 2017/04/11
fixed the NaN bug.
# ```version 0.0.1 beta```
`[2017/04/09] add the gravity system, now you can set the mass and velocity!`
#### version 0.0.1 alpha build3 2017/04/08
fixed a few bugs, added the proto-acceleration system.
#### version 0.0.1 alpha build2 2017/04/05
made some impressive progress on code deploying, separating the code into different files makes code easier to manage. 
#### version 0.0.1 alpha build1 2017/04/01
has a basic frame, while the content is still very boring. By the way, the background picture and the icon is just for testing.<pr>
I don't think we are able to use them since the competition requires original pictures :(
