#### version 0.0.2 build1 2017/04/11
fixed the NaN bug
### version 0.0.1 release 2017/04/09
add the gravity system, now you can set the mass and velocity!
#### version 0.0.1 build3 2017/04/08
fixed a few bugs, added the proto-acceleration system
#### version 0.0.1 build2 2017/04/05
made some impressive progress on code deploying, separating the code into different files makes code easier to manage. 
#### version 0.0.1 build1 2017/04/01
has a basic frame, while the content is still very boring. By the way, the background picture and the icon is just for testing.<pr>
I don't think we are able to use them since the competition requires original pictures :(
