## logs
### version 0.0.1 build2 2017/04/05
made some impressive progress on code deploying, separating the code into different files makes code easier to manage. 
### version 0.0.1 build1 2017/04/01
has a basic frame, while the content is still very boring. By the way, the background picture and the icon is just for testing.<pr>
I don't think we are able to use them since the competition requires original pictures :(
